  s.description      = <<-DESC
    AXSwift is a Swift wrapper for OS X's C-based accessibility client APIs. Working with these APIs
    is error-prone and a huge pain, so AXSwift makes everything easier:

    - Modern API that's 100% Swift
    - Explicit error handling
    - Complete coverage of the underlying C API
    - Better documentation than Apple's, which is pretty poor

    This framework is intended as a basic wrapper and doesn't keep any state or do any "magic".
    That's up to you!
